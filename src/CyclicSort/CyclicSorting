Check -> Swap -> Change.
The functioning of the cyclic sort depends on checking if the value at index i is at its correct index or not, if not at the correct index, it should be swapped with the value at that correct index, and then verified, if the value at i is at the correct index (arr[i]-1) or not.
This is known as Cyclic Sorting.
